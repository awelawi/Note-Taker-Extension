This is the Ongoing Development of the Note Taker Extension
The purpose of this extension is for online readers to have a seamless experience when reading on a web page.
I noticed how useful it'll be if I could save notes for some of my class online readings. If you print out a webpage current tools like adobe, google drive etc make it difficult to add comments to the pdf version. Thus the need for this chrome extension
At the time of comletion:
Users should be able to temporarily highlight on a text
Be prompted to add a note with a short popup like note
User adds a title of this note, and includes the actual note
Once added, this note is saved to google docs of similar title
User can also click on that note to add more text.

Current Features
- Notes are saved in a table format including the title of notes, the web page name, and date the note was taken
- The user can change the background colors of the note
- The textbox area is resized whenever the user minimizes the tab

Working on Features
- The rows should be clickable such that the user can view the full note in a modal dialog box. This'll mean that the notes in the table is merely just a preview
- The table should be sorted in descending order of recency. Most recent to least recent
- The UI can look better

Future Features or Stretch Goals
- There should be a search bar at the top of the table to search the note by title, or date
- There should be a filter button(thjis might noit be useful)
- Searched note should be highlighted
