This is the Ongoing Development of the Note Taker Extension
The purpose of this extension is for online readers to have a seamless experience when reading on a web page.
I noticed how useful it'll be if I could save notes for some of my class online readings. If you print out a webpage current tools like adobe, google drive etc make it difficult to add comments to the pdf version. Thus the need for this chrome extension
At the time of comletion:
Users should be able to temporarily highlight on a text
Be prompted to add a note with a short popup like note
User adds a title of this note, and includes the actual note
Once added, this note is saved to google docs of similar title
User can also click on that note to add more text.
